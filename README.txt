Welcome to the pb_ray project! This will be a ray tracer that is initially
based on the first edition of the book "Physically Based Rendering: From Theory to 
Implementation". There is a second edition of the book, but SafariBooksOnline
only has the first edition. An Amazon link to the second edition of the book is
here:

I have several goals for this project:

- Implement the ray tracer as described by the book.
- Write unit tests along the way using the gtest framework.
- Make the ray tracer buildable on Windows (Visual Studio 2010) and
	*nix variants (using gcc/make/etc - I'll take suggestions for other
	build systems here since I know other popular systems have arisen
	since I've done any serious *nix development other than what is used at
	my current workplace).
