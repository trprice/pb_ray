////////////////////
// struct: Matrix4x4
//
// Purpose:
//      Provide a transformation matrix and corresponding functinoality.
//
// Notes:
//      This is setup as a struct in the book.
//          - To my understanding the only significant difference between a
//            struct and a class is the default access level.
//              - A struct's members are public by default whereas a classes
//                are private.
//          - It is also my understanding that in the context of C++ where
//            classes are used to make objects that can be acted upon with
//            their member functions, structs should be reserved for POD types
//            (plain old data) that simply needs organization and no other
//            functionality.
